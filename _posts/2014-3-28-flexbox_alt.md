title: flexbox alternative for elastic rows 
---

needed a way to keep a dynamic list of items looking tidy w/o flexbox.  
the requirements:  
	
1. rows by default would have an explicit number of equally sized items.  
2. if the last row had fewer items, the items would each take an equal size and fill the entire row.
